# DeepLearningIST
This readme contains everything you need to complete Homework 1. It contains
the following files:

utils.py
- used to create the datasets for the classification task at hand.

download_octmnist.py
- allows you to download the OCTMNIST dataset to a compressed .npz file,
  which hw1-q2.py and hw1-q3.py can load.

hw1-q1.py
- contains the code for Question 1, which covers classification with
  the perception, logistic regression, and the multi-layer perceptron, with
  implementation in numpy. 

hw1-q2.py
- contains the code for Question 2, which covers classification with
  logistic regression and the multi-layer perceptron, with implementation in
  Pytorch.

hw1-q3.py
- contains some code to double check whether the network structure for question 3 could mimick the given function in the question properly. It just passes the vectors for a certain A,B and D through a forward pass function for the specified network.
